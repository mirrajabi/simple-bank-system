# simple-bank-system
This was a simple stupid university project. The goal was to make a simple bank deposit/withdraw system in C#.

It's a windows form application and you'll need visual studio or something. or just copy the code and do whatever with it.
Be a better human and don't sell this source to your friends for money. But if you don't care then just do WTF you want.

Cheers ;)
